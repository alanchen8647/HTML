                <p class="proect-Subtitle">CUNY Students' Essential tools for Success</p>
                <p>The CUNY Tech Prep program hosted this hackathon with the theme “Build the first iteration of your project that creates solutions to making CUNY Essential Needs more accessible to CUNY students.” We started by brainstorming keywords to identify the challenges we face as CUNY students. We realized that access to information is crucial, whether it’s knowing which office on campus taht provides career or academic assistance, or being aware of upcoming campus events that could potentially help students to connect with each other. With these insights, we decided to create a website that consolidates all upcoming campus events and resources to support students’ academic journeys. The main goal is to reduce the time and effort students need to find this information.</p>
                <p>There are no restrictions on the tools and languages for this hackathon. We chose to use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the website’s front-end. Realizing the need for a database to store event information and student calendar data, we decided on Firebase. Its authentication and real-time database features provided a quick and effective solution for our login and data storage needs.</p>
                <p>The biggest challenge we faced during development was finding time to collaborate and communicate. Most of us had work commitments during the three-day hackathon, leading to an uneven distribution of tasks based on each person’s availability. Some team members couldn’t complete their assigned work on time due to their jobs, which meant the rest of us had to pause our tasks to take over the unfinished ones.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Next Step: There are a lot of features that we wanted to implement but fail to complete before due dates. Our team decided to still work on the project and make it aesthetically pleasing while ensuring we implement all the features we talked about, such as login page, calendar features that connects to the events, allows students to post blogs and differentiate accounts between regular students and the official accounts for posting.</p>
