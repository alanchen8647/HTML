                <p>Followed the weekly Scrum cycle in a team of 5 with the goal to re-design a new landing page for the start-up company Unadat in 4 weeks. The tool we used is mainly the google cloud shell </p>
                <p>Throught out the process of designing the website, the CEO of Unadat Sean, provided a lot of valuable feedback such as the idea of call to action and how different features might have affect user's experience and attention paid in these information. As a team we discuss the meaning behind these changes and debate on different idea and solutions that might applied and solve the problem our PM brought up.
